/* 
    There are 3 conditions in this problem
        1.G -> G
        2.() -> o
        3.(al) -> al
    
    So, we check for "G" first => " if(command.charAt(i) == 'G') "

    As you can see, the first letter of all conditions are only "G", and "(". 

    So, we check for the next letter; if it's ")", the result will be "o" => else if(command.charAt(i+1) == ')')

    Unless it's ")" , the result will be "al" 

    When we want to add a new letter into a String, we don't use "String + "x" ", because it's much slower. 
    
    We will use the "append" method of StringBuilder instead. 

    after we finish all the these, we turn our StringBuilder into String by using ".toString()" method.
