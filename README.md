Leetcode solution in java and some explanation (as a newbie)!!

Hello everyone, I'm interested in coding and I want to share my leetcode solution with my thought process.

I will keep coding and sharing; I hope that my github will help or inspire someone in the future.

My plan:
1. try to finish all easy problems in leetcode.
2. try to finish all medium problems in leetcode.
3. try to rewrite some solutions in diffenrent programing languages.
4. try to finish all hard problems in leetcode.
