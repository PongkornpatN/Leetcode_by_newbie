/*
This problem is not that hard. the depth of parentheses of each character is counted by how many '(' in front of it.

So, we create 2 variables to count and check for max depth. 

        int count = 0 ;
        int max = 0; 
        
        
            if(s.charAt(i) == '('){
                count++;
            }


However, the depth of '(' is canceled by ')'; eventhough there is no character, we count it as a pair anyway. 



            else if (s.charAt(i) == ')'){
                if(max < count){
                    max = count;
                }
                count--;
            } 
        
then we return max as an answer 


        return max;
